## Some useful scripts for participating in Programming Contests with DOM Judge

### Dependencies (Python3)
- lxml
- requests
- requests_toolbelt

### How to use submit.py:

1. Enter your login data in the login.sample.py file and rename it to login.py
2. Get usage details with python3 submit.py -h
3. The script follows the folder structure generated by init.sh - so maybe you
have to change either the script or your folder structure. Or you send a pull
request with a more generic script.
4. Be the first one to submit on Thursday ;-)
